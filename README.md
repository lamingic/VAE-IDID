# VAE-IDID
**Project Outlines: VAE-IDID**

VAE-IDID represents an innovative extension of the established Ev-IDID toolkit~(please refer to https://github.com/lamingic/Ev-IDID), specifically tailored to address complex I-DID (Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagram) problems with enhanced precision and capabilities. Building upon the solid foundation laid by Ev-IDID, VAE-IDID refines and augments its predecessor's functionalities, offering a superior approach to I-DID modeling.

Furthermore, the repository functions as supplementary material for our paper titled "**Exploiting Behavior Sequences for Multi-agent Interactive Decision Making through Variational Autoencoder**" .
